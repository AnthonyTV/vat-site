        <p align="justify" class="style10">The website was developed in 2017 after the realization that students were facing challenges in applying for off-campus accommodation. Students were not well informed on the various boarding house available as well as contact details so as to book places for accommodation.Students had to travel to make reservations which was very inconvenient for those living in distant places. </p>
        <p align="justify" class="style10">The good news is, it is now possible to make online bookings as well as making online payments for accommdation from any place as long as there is internet connection. Landlords can now register their homes which will be advertised on the website. Students can then look at the various places and make comparisons based on personal preference and then make a booking. What are you waiting for? Sign up and begin to explore various places up for grabs for your next semester at your university.</p>
